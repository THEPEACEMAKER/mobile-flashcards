# Mobile Flashcards App

## About:

This app was built as a project for the [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
It is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards/questions to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

It was designed for Android, despite the fact that some components could also be used on IOS.
